                                     Testing

Background: 
Testing is the method of examination between maker and user, which is used by student knowledge, skill & idea and university software.   Testing is the process of finding out the perfect task of a student level and skill by use of university software.  

Aim: 
ensure all the customer requirement fulfil and all the functional and nonfunctional work properly. 

Acceptance Tests: 
The acceptance testing is design by university where some functional and nonfunctional requirement are test separately.it is testing for the university so we have two different user one is student, and another is maker, so there could be different criteria accosting to user. According to the test criteria we must do acceptance testing of the following function per as user student:
	Bibliographies checking: student can check whether the bibliographies are in correct order and follow the references styles. While they used data, they can put different format.
	Quotations exclusion: while student include some quotations, they can check the quotation are same as author but if student put wrong information but still don’t shows error then it is not acceptant. 
	System to check minimum number of the similar words: when student upload some assessment should provide the number of similarity even it doesn’t have similarity. For example, if the information is 100% different then system provide information about there is 0-word matching. Otherwise student doesn’t system have the function about the checking similarity world.
	Resubmission:
Due to some problem of the internet or other technical problem file take long time to submission so student doesn’t know about it upload or not. So, they have to notify via email or SMS. Once we submit but again shows the resubmission then system will be fails.
	Submit the assignment before and after the date. If student can still submit the assignment with maker permission, then this system will not acceptance.
	Format of the file that only accept from the system: in case of the file format differ then system and user or student is different than system can’t be accept.

So above criteria testing is for user student but as a system we have another user called maker or assessment checker. So, it has also some criteria according to acceptance testing of following function as user maker:
	 Bibliographies checking: while checking the submission file if maker can’t figure out the bibliographies then system will be fail. 
	Quotations exclusion: while maker check quotation it shows right even its wrong and doesn’t exist then it will be fails.
	System to check minimum no of the similar words: while maker check the file if system shows more or less number of similar world then it will be fail.  
	Resubmission: In resubmission process maker can submit wrong file in that case maker can’t delete and resubmit file this will be not accepted.
	Can’t change submission date for the student then this system will not be accepted. 


Driven test: 
This test check performance of the system and it function. It is a type of the functional automatic testing framework. For example, while student or maker upload the file or information, and refresh the page than it saves the file or discard.


Blackbox Testing: 
It is a process of just giving the input and analysis the output from the system.  So, we 
 Must check system called Print Dialogue MS Word 2016. There are lots of functions which can be check as follows:


                     
                        Input                                                                                            Output

1	Configuration Management:

Version management:
Version management is process of control the track and changes to collection of related entities. It deals with the configuration setting, templates, rule, shared inclusion and documentation. The benefits of the version management are as follows in the source code:
	Organize, coordinated management of any changes.
	Organize the new feature of with potentially.
	A reliable master copy of the property from building process.
It is very essentially tools and tools by themselves are not sufficient for effective version management, we also need well defined version management process.
The best example is GitHub.
My GitHub account is  bijayashah
https://github.com/bijayashah/CMP73010-Ass1-2018


Build Management:
Microsoft nightly build system is the process of each day doing a software build of the latest version of the program. This is it can first be complied to ensure the problem and bug. It like parents and child where manager is guide to other programmer and developer. In the Git hub, programmer is working on the their task by individual once they done all the module are upload and submit to git hub where manager are responsible for organize.   
 
Figure: chart of test progress report.

	Advantage of Automatic Build Process and other system:
•	It is automating how the software is built instead of the manually invoking the complier. It has some tools like make and fork. Where other system has not those function.
•	it is free if it is open source and include wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more in-depth documentation and get feedback about our project. 
•	Automatic build process uses the markdown system which allow us to use text editor to write down formatted documentation.
•	This process scans the all developer progress every interval of the time it is very flexible to solve the problem rather than going back later.
•	It does have integration option which have common platforms such as Amazon or google.
•	It is very time and cost effective. 


	Disadvantage of Automatic Build Process and other system:
The major demerits of the automatic build process come at the end of the project. It is not possible to finish all team member task on same time. It leads to whole system failure. In the team there could be beginner or learner and they can’t keep up with another team member. so, could be major drawback. 


	Releasing product date in public:
    Beta format is developed through the automated testing like manual testing, unit testing and regression test. It gives the feedback by Microsoft developer, reviews the report and reviews developer after that it has been fix the problem and bugs which is field by developers. Distribution system made up of various system, which is needing to look after like transparency, openness, scalability, security, quality of service and risk. After acceptance and Blackbox testing system is almost ready but we have to check the customer requirement. Customer are check for their requirement and we implement those function and will be check once all functional and nonfunctional requirement. All this process done we going to releases or handover the product.
